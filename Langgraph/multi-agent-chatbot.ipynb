       "AIMessage(content=\"\\n<think>\\nOkay, the user is asking for the capital of France. Let me think. I remember that France is a country in Europe. The capital cities of countries are usually their most important cities, often where the government is based.\\n\\nWait, Paris comes to mind. Isn't Paris the capital? But I should make sure I'm not mixing it up with another country. Let me recall some basic geography. France, along with countries like Spain, Italy, Germany, and the UK, are part of Western Europe. Spain's capital is Madrid, Italy's Rome, Germany's Berlin, and the UK's London. So that's different. \\n\\nI think Paris is the capital of France. But I want to be certain. Maybe I can think of landmarks associated with France. The Eiffel Tower is in Paris, and the Louvre Museum too. Those are major attractions, so it's likely the capital. \\n\\nAlternatively, could it be Lyon or Marseille? Lyon is a big city, but I don't think it's the capital. Marseille is a major port city but again, not the capital. \\n\\nAnother angle: the French government's seat. The President of France works in Paris, right? The Élysée Palace is in Paris. The National Assembly and Senate meet there as well. That reinforces the idea that Paris is indeed the capital. \\n\\nWait, in history, when has the capital been different? During wars or invasions? For example, during World War II, the government was in Vichy for a time, but that's a temporary situation. The official capital remained Paris. \\n\\nAlso, in terms of international recognition, all sources point to Paris as the capital. I don't recall any recent changes to the capital of France. So I can confidently say that the answer is Paris. \\n\\nJust to double-check in case of any confusion with similar-sounding names or common misconceptions. Sometimes people might confuse capitals, like thinking the capital of Italy is Milan instead of Rome, but in France's case, there's no major confusion I'm aware of. \\n\\nTherefore, the capital of France is Paris.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe capital of France is **Paris**.
